Welcome to the Hoersverse Github Project!

This is a fan project which initially consisted in recreating part of the in-universe internet of Stardust, a My Little Pony fan comic made by CaptainHoers.
Check it out right here: https://stardustinternational.tumblr.com/

The project has grown wider and now focus on CaptainHoers' different comics as a whole.
This project is very much a work in progress and will be updated when I feel like it.
If you stumble upon it before I have made it known to the public, well, lucky you.

You can access the different sites from: https://cozygollyglow.github.io/Hoersverse/
