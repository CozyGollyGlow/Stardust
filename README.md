Welcome to the Stardust Github Project!

This is a fan project about recreating part of the in-universe internet of Stardust, a My Little Pony fan comic made by CaptainHoers.
Check it out right here: https://stardustinternational.tumblr.com/

This project is very much a work in progress and will be updated when I feel like it.
If you stumble upon it before I have made it known to the public, well, lucky you.
